For security reasons, the Unicode character U+0000 must be replaced with the REPLACEMENT CHARACTER (U+FFFD).

Architecturally, the sh and bash shell use the NULL
character (Unicode; U+0000, Hex: \\x00, Oct: \\000) as a separator,
and this character cannot be part of the value of variables
and, accordingly, cannot be replaced.
